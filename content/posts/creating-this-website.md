## 13/2/2025  

Today I created this website successfully with the help of my friend.  

Actually, I started working on creating this website yesterday, and I had already built it. But I couldn’t make the website look the same as it did on localhost. I sought help from ChatGPT, which helped me, but I still hadn’t solved the error. Then, my laptop’s battery was close to dead, so I turned it off and decided to continue tomorrow—which is today.  

This evening, I called my friend. He was **surprised** that I had actually created this website because I had been trying to make it for about **two months** without success. So, when I finally made it, he was really **shocked**.

## What I Learned While Creating This Website  
- **Learned to use some Git commands**  
- **Got to know how to change my GitHub username**  
- **Got to know how to delete unwanted GitHub repos**  

I guess that's all—maybe I forgot something.

## Future Posts  
I will be posting my **day-to-day life events** on this website.  

**idk** who is reading this, but if you are, **idk**, just continue reading all my other posts too.

**See ya!**
