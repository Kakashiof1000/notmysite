## A Different Day  

You may think why I chose this name for this blog. Well, my brain is not braining, so I just named it whatever came to my mind.  

### Morning Routine 
Woke up at 5 AM, then scrolled mindlessly on Instagram for like 45+ mins. After that, I started studying classwork.  

Since I created a website yesterday, I wanted to change its theme. Initially, I tried the **Coder** theme, but the content wasn’t visible, so I switched to **PaperMod** instead. Changing the theme took some time. After some chatting with my friend, I left for college.  

### Industrial Case Study Competition 
Since I'm in **IRP**, I got OD to attend an industrial case study competition. I was curious to learn something new, but the chief guests kept talking for about **3 hours** straight. After that, there was a **tea break** , and then the actual competition began.  

I watched one team present their case study, but since we had a lab session, my friends and I left to attend it. We did our experiments and then headed back home.  

Today felt **different** from the usual day-to-day cycle, so maybe that's why I named this post **"A Different Day"**. (I see you read this far :D).

## PCB Design 
After coming home, I took **rest for an hour**, then started thinking about what to do in the evening. The **speaker project** from my friend came to mind (**PCB designing**).  

I opened **KiCAD** after **2 weeks**, so I wasn’t in the flow. I checked my **ChatGPT history**, remembered something, and got back to work. My goal was to **finish it today**, and I managed to complete **80%** of the design—just a few more things left to do.  

### Things I Learned Today:  
-  **Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps)**  
-  Forgot how to design footprints, so had to **relearn it**  
-  **RC Low-Pass Filter**  

I might have forgotten something, but that’s all for now!
