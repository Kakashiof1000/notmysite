So, as the name says, it's just another Sunday, doing what I always do. But today, I did some case studies about transmission lines since I have to submit a report tomorrow.  

I watched some YouTube videos sent by my teacher and browsed Google for more information on the topic. After completing that, I opened the **Spider-Man** game and played for like 3 or 4 hours. That game is really fun, though!  

Then, I started writing class notes—completing the ones I missed since I was at **NIT Trichy** a week ago for three days. I ended up writing for straight 3 hours without even realizing it! Maybe the music I was listening to did the magic. When I finally finished, it was already **6:56 PM**.  

After that, I didn’t know what to do, so I watched a movie with my family—because why not make it a **Sunday Movie Night**? After the movie ended, I opened my laptop and started writing this blog for today.  

I wanted to do something productive today, but I didn’t really do anything *extra productive*. Still, I managed to complete some assignments, classwork, and my report, so I feel like I spent the day somewhat usefully.  

I guess that’s it for today's blog. **See you in the next one!**
