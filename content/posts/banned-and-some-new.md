**Today i tried to copy paste a code in skillrack** while skillrack doesn't allow students to copy paste code i did it by reffering some github repo and *i got banned* and now i got banned for 2 days,now i can't score on skillrack and i just guess the ban will go in two days if it doesnt then i go to staff and inform about this and then get scolded for this and get *the ban* removed.

Then,today i haven't attended the classes in the college as there was event conducted by our college with **Puthiya thalaimurai** TV channel we went to attend that,that took the most time in the college and then i and my friends went to IRP 
while asking my class-coordinator for OD to go to IRP he asked about the details of our project and the discussion gone like 15 to 20 minutes *haaaa then we went to IRP but forgot to submit the OD form in department so again we went to the department and submitted that form then we started working on that project as my friend was doing some works on the project and i didnt had anything to do i started working on my own project there.
The time went very fast while we were at IRP today then we came to home

**After coming to home and getting fresh** i called my friend to play that *carry the glass* game we played for like 20 to 30 mins then we both own works to do,so we stopped the game in the mid and gone to do those works.

## University on abroad

I researched about pursuing higher studies in abroad like in germany and turkey 

### Things i found 

while doing researches i found that to study in germany universities some ask fee about 15k to 30k(rupees) per year and some about 1 lakh(rupees) per year also they needed the student to have a blocked account containing about 10lakhs for spending while they are on germany,so i cant do that much money,
so i did some more research then found about some scholarships programs that abroad students to study in universities like this

then i continued my search then found about hungary and tukey universities they don't need the **blocked account** so i saw some details about them 

**about the scholarships** i have to apply for those 1 year before i get graduated since i have one more year left i can apply for it next year.


### THINGS I FOUND 
- you have to maintain your CGPA like 7 to 8 
- proficiency in english(german and turkish also preferred based on the universities)
- the blocked account
that's all i guess(there is more but this is more important)

then i revised some circuit theory topics and then came here to write the blog

**This is it for today and i will change myself in the upcoming days and make this blog website more useful for anyone with my upcoming blogs**

Thanks for reading this far,see'ya in the next blog.
