Today is the beginning of the weekend. I planned on doing three things today:  

1. Doing Skillrack  
2. Studying some topics on Circuit Theory  
3. Learning some things about Amplifiers  

Even though I wanted to do these things, I have only done one thingâ€”Skillrack. I couldn't do the other things as I spent **1 hour** speaking with my friend on call. I will do those things **tomorrow morning and evening**.  

During the call, my friend mentioned some **changes on the PCB** I designed for him. I then asked if he had any other projects related to PCB designing, and he told me about a **home automation project using Raspberry Pi**. So, I asked him to send me a text explaining both the **changes** and the **home automation project**.  

Then, he asked me to install a game called **"Carry the Glass."** I installed it and called him to play the game, but he had some **problems opening the game**. So, we decided to play the game **tomorrow evening**.  

After that, I did some **Skillrack problems**, and once I completed them, I came here to write the blog.  

So, this is what I wanted to share today.see,ya.
