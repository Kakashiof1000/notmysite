I wanted to do something productive today but spent my evening playing game **Carry the Glass**  
he took like 45 mins *i guess*,for opening and playing that game while he was doing those i saw a game **supermarket together** in steam which is there for *free* so i asked my friend to download it.

Due to his slow internet he can't download the game faster, meanwhile, I downloaded the game within four to five minutes. Then he saw a post on **Reddit** then he followed that post and finally he was able to open that game.  

### Gaming time  
Then after those installing processes we finally opened the game and played it for like around 2 hrs after that I wanted to do some classwork on *home* so I told him and left the game but during the gameplay he really tested my patience like the game was easy but he made it look ***harder*** then yeah I thought that if I play that game continuously I would learn to gain a lot of patience I guess but the thing is my friend won't play regularly with me that's the problem else we would complete the game fastly >i guess so.  

So coming for today classes,those were was not boring as yesterday but idk what I learned today by attending the classes, then there was this lab >linear and digital integrated circuits.Where I gave the circuit but designed my own circuit instead of following the one on the manual so I decided to do one on my own then it actually worked. So, I was little happy.  

### Productivity  
> so,what i did productive today?

you may ask that question,i created a portfolio website today but i can't create that website successfully today and it was my fault but later realized i shouldn't do with hugo since i created the website using hugo.And also did some skillrack today also the changes my friend told to do on the pcb design he today so i changed the pcb schmatic today tomorrow i would complete it and get to the footprint and pcb part,so this is what i did productivly today.  

so,this is it for the blog today.
