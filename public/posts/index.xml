      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1322025&#34;&gt;13/2/2025&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I created this website successfully with the help of my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I started working on creating this website yesterday, and I had already built it. But I couldn’t make the website look the same as it did on localhost. I sought help from ChatGPT, which helped me, but I still hadn’t solved the error. Then, my laptop’s battery was close to dead, so I turned it off and decided to continue tomorrow—which is today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
