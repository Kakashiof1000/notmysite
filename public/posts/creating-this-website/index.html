Today i created this website succesfully with the help of my friend
actually i started working on creating this website yesterday and i have created it yesterday itself but i cant bring the website to look the same as it
looks in the localhost and i seeked the help of the chatGPT and that helped me but still i havent solved that error and my laptop&rsquo;s battery came close to dead
so i turned off the laptop and i decided to tmrw which i today so today evening called my friend he was suprised that i actually created this website coz i was
trying to make this website for like 2 months i guess and can&rsquo;t make it so which made him suprised that i made the website.</p>
<p>What i learned while creating this website:
*learned to use some git commands
*got to know how to change github username
*got to know how to delete unwanted github repos
i guess that&rsquo;s all maybe i may have forgot</p>
<p>i will be posting my day to day life events in website
idk who is reading this but if you are reading this idk just continue to read all my other posts too</p>
