Today I created this website successfully with the help of my friend.
Actually, I started working on creating this website yesterday, and I had already built it. But I couldn’t make the website look the same as it did on localhost. I sought help from ChatGPT, which helped me, but I still hadn’t solved the error. Then, my laptop’s battery was close to dead, so I turned it off and decided to continue tomorrow—which is today.">
