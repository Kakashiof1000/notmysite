Today i created this website succesfully with the help of my friend
actually i started working on creating this website yesterday and i have created it yesterday itself but i cant bring the website to look the same as it
looks in the localhost and i seeked the help of the chatGPT and that helped me but still i havent solved that error and my laptop&amp;rsquo;s battery came close to dead
so i turned off the laptop and i decided to tmrw which i today so today evening called my friend he was suprised that i actually created this website coz i was
trying to make this website for like 2 months i guess and can&amp;rsquo;t make it so which made him suprised that i made the website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
